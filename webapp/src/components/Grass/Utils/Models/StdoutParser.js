/**
 * @description Use this parameter to automatically parse the output of GRASS GIS modules and convert the output into tables, lists or key/value pairs in the result section of the response.If the property type is set to *table*, *list* or *kv* then the stdout of the current command will be parsed and the result of the parse operation will be added to the result dictionary using the provided id as key. GRASS GIS modules produce regular output. Many modules have the flag *-g* to create key value pairs as stdout output. Other create a list of values or a table with/without header.
 * @param {String} id The unique id that is usâ€¦ the result dictionary.
 * @param {String} format The stdout format to be parsed.
 * @param {String} delimiter The delimiter that should be used to parse table, list and key/value module output. Many GRASS GIS  modules use by default \"|\" in tables and \"=\" in key/value pairs. A new line \"\\n\" is always the delimiter between rows in the output.
